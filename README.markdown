### Philosophy

The philosophy behind RuneTekk was simplicity and efficency coupled together in harmony. The server uses little to no 
java utility API but does not try and pull the wool over your eyes with mumbo jumbo code of any kinda. It's to the 
point and as optimized as could be. The server was designed to serve the user and give a good platform where there
could be no excuse that the base was at fault for any speed or effiency issues. 

### Background

The server was originally created by SiniSoul (Hadyn Fitzgerald) to be used as the Runelocus community project.
